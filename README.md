## Project Overview
This is my portfolio, inspired by Master JS. I’ve used components from Aceternity UI and customized them with my own style. There’s still a lot I’d love to enhance to make it more beautiful, elegant, and modern  but I’m proud of the progress so far and excited for any opportunity to keep learning, improving, and growing my aesthetic sense.
